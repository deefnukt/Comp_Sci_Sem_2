    i havent gotten this far in the labs, The only way i could explain the first one is through a million for loops. Im pretty sure 
    the easiest way to do this would be to limit it to 8 numbers then you would be able to solve it easier but like i said im not sure. 
    I was able to get help from my group on the second lab but we didnt have enough time for the first one.
